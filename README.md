+ Project summary:  
For this project, we implemented different collaborative filtering algorithms on 2 datasets and evaluated the performances. Our team worked on:

Memory-based Algorithm:  

Similarity weight - Vector Similarity (Data1,2)  
Similarity weight - Mean Square Difference (Data1,2)  
Similarity weight - SimRank (Data2)  
Variance weighting - No  
Selecting Neighbors - Weight Threshold (Data1,2)  
Selecting Neighbors - Best-n-estimator (Data1,2)  
Selecting Neighbors - Combined (Data1,2)

Model-based Algorithm:  
Cluster models (Data1)
